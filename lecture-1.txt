Computer Networking Notes (Clean & Presentable)

1. Benefits of Networking in a Company

Monitoring of devices

Centralized control

Easy connection between devices

Hardware and data sharing

Main networking devices: Hub, Switch

Media used: WiFi, Cable

To connect more than 2 devices, networking devices are required

2. Types of Networks

a) LAN (Local Area Network)

Covers small area (like home, office) up to 100 meters

Uses networking devices to connect PCs

Client sends request to the server; if valid, it is accepted

Advantages

Easy maintenance

Faster communication

Easy configuration

Disadvantages

Limited number of devices

Connecting too many devices decreases performance

b) CAN (Campus Area Network)

Multiple LANs or group of LANs form a CAN

Covers areas like college campus or office campus

Example: LAN 1 + LAN 2 + LAN 3 → CAN

c) MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)

Covers a city (approx 100 km coverage)

Supports data and voice communication

Connects multiple campuses/areas within a city

d) WAN (Wide Area Network)

Unlimited coverage

Connects worldwide using the Internet

Depends on geographical conditions

WAN = Combination of multiple MANs

e) PAN (Personal Area Network)

Used for personal devices using Bluetooth

Coverage depends on Bluetooth version

Connects devices like phone, laptop, earbuds

f) SAN (Storage Area Network)

Creates centralized storage for data backup

Data can be retrieved whenever needed

Helps recover files after data breach

3. Network Topologies

Topologies = Structure of how devices are connected

Types:

Physical Topology – actual physical layout

Logical Topology – how data travels between devices

a) Bus Topology

Single backbone cable

Terminators at both ends

Max 30 devices

200 meters long

Communication Types:

Broadcast: one-to-all

Unicast: one-to-one

Multicast: one-to-many (selected)

Disadvantages:

No privacy

Data breach risk

Uses Thinnet/Thicknet cables

b) Star Topology

Most popular

All devices connected to a central device (Hub/Switch)

Switch has replaced Hub

Note: Hub always broadcasts → No privacy

c) Ring Topology

Devices connected in a circular loop

Data flows in one direction (clockwise)

Each computer acts as repeater

If one device fails → entire network goes down

Dual Ring:

Two cables

Primary ring (clockwise)

Secondary ring (anti-clockwise)

Backup used when main fails

d) Mesh Topology

Every device is connected to every other device

Uses routing to find best communication path

Commonly used in WAN for interconnecting LANs

Types:

Full Mesh → All connected to all

Partial Mesh → Only required devices connected
